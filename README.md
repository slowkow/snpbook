# snpbook

<img src="snpbook.gif"/>

A proof of concept for computing linkage disequilibrium (LD) between single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and visualizing it with [d3].

Uses [tabix] running on the [iobio] server to pull genotype data from a [VCF]
file hosted on the [BEAGLE] website.

All done in the web browser with Javascript!
